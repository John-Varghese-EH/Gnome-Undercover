**Seamlessly transform your GNOME desktop into a convincing Windows 11 environment and back—instantly, with one command or click.**

This project GNOME-Undercover is to use modern Windows 11 themes and a more robust installation process. It provides a simple, one-click script that transforms your GNOME desktop into a polished Windows 11 look-alike, and safely restores your original settings when you switch back.

## 📦 Installation via Package Managers

### 🐧 Debian/Ubuntu/Mint/Kali (`apt`)
Hosted via **PPA** (Personal Package Archive).
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome-undercover/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gnome-undercover
```
*(Official Launchpad PPA: [launchpad.net/gnome-undercover](https://launchpad.net/gnome-undercover))*

### 🏹 Arch Linux/Manjaro (`pacman`)
Available via **AUR** (Arch User Repository).
```bash
yay -S gnome-undercover
```
*(Note: You need to push the PKGBUILD to the AUR first)*

### 🎩 Fedora/RedHat/OpenSUSE (`dnf`/`zypper`)
Hosted via **COPR**.
```bash
sudo dnf install gnome-undercover
```
*(Note: You need to set up a COPR repository first)*

### 🔧 Manual Install (`.deb` build)
If you prefer building from source:

1. Install build dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install devscripts build-essential debhelper dh-python python3-all python3-setuptools
   ```
2. Build the package:
   ```bash
   debuild -us -uc
   ```
3. Install:
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i ../gnome-undercover_*.deb
   sudo apt install -f  # To fix any missing dependencies
   ```

## 🚀 Installation (Source)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/John-Varghese-EH/Gnome-Undercover.git
cd Gnome-Undercover
```

### 2. Run the Installer

This script will guide you through the process, asking for `sudo` permission only when needed to install required system packages.

```bash
./scripts/gnome-undercover-setup
```

The installer will automatically:
- Install required dependencies (`git`, `gnome-tweaks`, `sassc`, `jq`, etc.).
- Download and set up the Windows 11 themes, icons, wallpaper, and extensions.
- Create a desktop launcher in your application grid.
- Install a panel button for easy access.

---

## 🖱️ Usage

After installation, you can switch between "Windows 11 Mode" and your original GNOME desktop in two ways:

- **From the App Grid:**  
  Search for “GNOME Undercover” in your applications and click the icon to toggle modes.

- **From the Panel:**
  Click the new icon in your top panel to toggle modes.

**How it Works:**
- **First run:** Your original GNOME settings are backed up, and the Windows 11 look is applied.
- **Second run (or next click):** Your original GNOME appearance is restored.

---

## 🧹 Uninstallation

To completely remove Gnome-Undercover and all its components, run the uninstallation script from the project directory:

```bash
chmod +x uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh
```
This will safely restore your original settings, remove all installed themes and icons, and delete the scripts and launchers.

## 🕵️ Inspiration: Kali Undercover & Why Gnome-Undercover

The popular **Kali Undercover** mode is a fantastic tool for quickly disguising your Kali Linux desktop to look like Windows, providing privacy and blending in during sensitive situations. However, **Kali Undercover has a major limitation: it only supports the Xfce desktop environment**, which is the default for Kali Linux.  
If you use GNOME—a modern, user-friendly, and highly customizable desktop environment—Kali Undercover simply won’t work for you.

**Why GNOME?**  
GNOME is increasingly popular among Kali users for its intuitive interface, advanced productivity features, and extensive customization options. With GNOME, you can enjoy a seamless workflow, elegant design, and access to a wide range of extensions and themes, making it a preferred choice for both new and experienced users.

> *“Kali Linux, a powerful Debian-based distribution widely used for advanced penetration testing and network security assessments, boasts a highly customizable environment. One popular option for enhancing the user interface and improving overall usability is to install GNOME on Kali Linux, a user-friendly desktop environment.”* 

**Gnome-Undercover** fills this gap by bringing undercover functionality to GNOME, allowing Kali users (and anyone running GNOME) to instantly switch between their native desktop and a convincing Windows-like environment—something Kali Undercover cannot do.
