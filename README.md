**Seamlessly transform your GNOME desktop into a convincing Windows 11 environment and back‚Äîinstantly.**

This project provides a simple, graphical installer to transform your modern GNOME desktop into a polished Windows 11 look-alike, and a one-click script to switch back and forth.

## üöÄ Installation

The installation is handled by a graphical wizard.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/John-Varghese-EH/Gnome-Undercover.git
cd Gnome-Undercover
```

### 2. Run the Installer

The installer will first check for necessary dependencies (like `git`, `python3-gi`, etc.) and guide you through installing them if they are missing.

```bash
python3 installer_gui/main.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions in the wizard to customize and install the theme suite.

## üñ±Ô∏è Usage

After installation, you can switch between "Windows 11 Mode" and your original GNOME desktop in two ways:

- **From the App Grid:**  
  Search for ‚ÄúGNOME Undercover‚Äù in your applications and click the icon to toggle modes.

- **From the Panel:**
  Click the new icon in your panel to toggle modes.

**How it Works:**
- **First run:** Your original GNOME settings are backed up, and the Windows 11 look is applied.
- **Second run (or next click):** Your original GNOME appearance is restored.

## üßπ Uninstallation

Currently, uninstallation is a manual process. A future version of the graphical installer will include an uninstallation option.

To manually remove the components, you will need to:
1.  Delete the theme files from `~/.themes` and `~/.icons`.
2.  Delete the core script from `~/.local/bin`.
3.  Delete the `.desktop` file from `~/.local/share/applications`.
4.  Disable and remove the `gnome-undercover@...` extension from `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions`.
5.  Delete the configuration directory at `~/.config/gnome-undercover`.
