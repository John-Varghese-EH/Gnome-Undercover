# GNOME Undercover üïµüèª

**Seamlessly transform your GNOME desktop into a convincing Windows 11 environment and back‚Äîinstantly, with one command or click.**

This project is an enhanced version of the original Gnome-Undercover concept, rebuilt to use modern Windows 11 themes and a more robust installation process. It provides a simple, one-click script that transforms your GNOME desktop into a polished Windows 11 look-alike, and safely restores your original settings when you switch back.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/John-Varghese-EH/Gnome-Undercover.git
cd Gnome-Undercover
```

### 2. Run the Installer

This script will guide you through the process, asking for `sudo` permission only when needed to install required system packages.

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer will guide you through the following steps:
1.  **Dependency Check:** It will verify you have all the necessary software and ask for permission to install anything that's missing.
2.  **Theme Customization:** It will present you with an interactive menu to choose your preferred color theme and enable optional tweaks like the blur effect.
3.  **Installation:** It will then download and install all the themes, icons, scripts, and extensions based on your selections.

## üñ±Ô∏è Usage

After installation, you can switch between "Windows 11 Mode" and your original GNOME desktop in two ways:

- **From the App Grid:**  
  Search for ‚ÄúGNOME Undercover‚Äù in your applications and click the icon to toggle modes.

- **From the Panel:**
  Click the new icon in your top panel to toggle modes.

**How it Works:**
- **First run:** Your original GNOME settings are backed up, and the Windows 11 look is applied.
- **Second run (or next click):** Your original GNOME appearance is restored.

## üßπ Uninstallation

To completely remove Gnome-Undercover and all its components, run the uninstallation script from the project directory:

```bash
chmod +x uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh
```
This will safely restore your original settings, remove all installed themes and icons, and delete the scripts and launchers.
